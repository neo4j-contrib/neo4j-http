== Main areas of work

Those are open topics:

- Create authenticator based on driver (when same password in basic auth as driver users, use that driver, otherwise create new instance and try to get a connection)
- Provide driver caching
- Per driver instance bookmark management
- Guestimator
- Use Jackson proper for formats
